### Fetching Plant Species with Related Data
```typescript
import { cosmic } from '@/lib/cosmic'

async function getPlantSpecies() {
  try {
    const response = await cosmic.objects
      .find({ type: 'plant-species' })
      .props(['id', 'title', 'slug', 'metadata'])
      .depth(1) // Include related objects
    
    return response.objects
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching plant species:', error)
    return []
  }
}
```

### Querying by Conservation Status
```typescript
async function getEndangeredSpecies() {
  try {
    const response = await cosmic.objects
      .find({ 
        type: 'plant-species',
        'metadata.conservation_status.key': 'EN' 
      })
      .depth(1)

## üåê Cosmic CMS Integration

This application connects to your Cosmic bucket to display:

- **Plant Species**: Scientific names, descriptions, characteristics, and images
- **Plant Families**: Taxonomic classifications with species counts
- **Habitats**: Native environments with climate and location data  
- **Plant Uses**: Traditional and modern applications
- **Conservation Data**: Protection status and environmental concerns

The content model uses object relationships to connect species with their families, habitats, and uses, creating a rich interconnected database of botanical information.
